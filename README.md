# Social-Network-API

## Description
This application is a fully functioning backend API that could be combined with a front-end UI to form a social network application.  This API allows you to create, update, and delete users, as well as get all users or a single user by id.  You can also attach thoughts, which have all of the above functionality, but they are connected to a user.  Lastly, you can add and remove reactions to other users thoughts, which are connected to a user and specific thought.
